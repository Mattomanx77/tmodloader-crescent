-CHANGELOG-
v0.4.7 - Perks pane. Last minor 0.4 update!
+ Redone the perks pane. Prepared and ready for the features to be brought in by v0.5
+ Fixed a bug causing dummies to grant astronomical amounts of XP.
= Changed how a boss XP bonus is given. The bonus granted is severely reduced every 100 levels.

v0.4.6.1 - No I'm not back.
+Fixed a bug causing Bards to have insanely negative inspiration. Irony!
If you already got hit by this, I'm sorry.

v0.4.6 - Stats pane and more mod support!
+Stats pane now updated to the new theme. One more to go!
+Support for Enigma and Expanded Sentries!
+Added 1 new perk: Vampiric Edge
+Vitality also increases how much healing you get from potions!
+Tweaked how bosses grant XP. The first time a boss is killed, the killer gains a whole level. Each following kill (as well as undocumented bosses) will now only grant +1%

v0.4.5.1 - Small fix
+Turned off a debug feature
+Added a new perk for your troubles: "Soft Landing"
+Fixed Adamant's scaling.
Origionally, Adamant would cost 100, 200, 300...
I decided to instead make it always cost 100.
Adamant would be a useless perk with increasing cost
Vitality would end up being more worth the points

+Added 1 new perk: "Adamant"
+Warning label for reset
+Tooltips for stats
+Disable enemy leveling option
+Half sized healthbar option

+Fix enemy scaling

v0.4.4.1 - Small tweak

But Post-Plantera brings it back to how it was.
+Added icons for Fortune/Dexterity
=Changed the symbols font to Georgia.

v0.4.4 - UI Overhaul Pt. 3
+Added settings menu! Open it using a button assigned in controls!
+Change the color of your resource bars!

+Fixed bug where the XP bar filled incorrectly
+Tweaked the cost of Overlord

+Fortune now runs on a diminishing return curve instead of being linear.
+Fortune now increases coins dropped by enemies
+Fortune now increases xp gained

=To compensate, the level curve has been steepened.

v0.4.1.1 - Bugfix
+Fixed most perks not returning the correct amount

v0.4.1 - Happy accidents
+Added 1 new stat: Fortune! every 25 points increases your crit chance by 1

=Re-priced some perks

v0.4 - UI Overhaul Pt. 1!
+Fixed my mod REQUIRING Thorium and Tremor. I made a strong reference on accident. Sorry!
+Major overhaul of the UI. Soon you'll be able to choose the color of the UI!
+Stats pane completely separate, can be dragged around, and kept open!
=Changed defence to add defence instead of multiply it
