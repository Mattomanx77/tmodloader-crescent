Fortitude (Effect: Increases overal defence by a percentage)
Intelligence (Effect: Increases magic damage and maximum mana)
Vitality (Effect: Increase maximum health)

See the ingame UI for perks and their descriptions!



-IN THE FUTURE (HOPEFULLY)-
Support for Tremor's Alchemist class(int)
Support for Thorium's Healer(rad) and Bard(dex) classes
More perks
Improve the UI to fit more into Terraria's theme. (Currently it's just a placeholder)
Something to make this mod balanced (Open to suggestions)
