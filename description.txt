This is a UI/RPG mod.
I made it in my spare time.
tl;dr: Stats, skills, and perks!

Adds a level UI (Click the top-right box)
In this UI, you have 7 stats, numerous perks, and skills.
Strength (Effect: Increase melee/throwing damage)
Agility (Effect: Increase movement speed)
Dexterity (Effect: Increase ranged damage)
Fortitude (Effect: Increases overall defence by 1 every 10 points)
Intelligence (Effect: Increases magic damage and maximum mana)
Vitality (Effect: Increase maximum health)
Radiance (Effect: Increases summoner damage)
See the ingame UI for perks/skills and their descriptions!



-IN THE FUTURE (HOPEFULLY)-
More perks/skills
Improve the UI to fit more into Terraria's theme. (Currently it's just a placeholder
However people seem to like it so I might just make it toggleable.)
Something to make this mod balanced (Open to suggestions)
Artifact Sacrifice (Collect a large amount of an accessory to unlock a related perk)
