This is a UI/RPG mod.
I made it in my spare time.

In this UI, you have 7 stats and numerous perks.
Strength (Effect: Increase melee damage)
Agility (Effect: Increase movement speed)
Dexterity (Effect: Increase throwing/ranged damage)
Fortitude (Effect: Increases overal defence by a percentage)
Intelligence (Effect: Increases magic damage and maximum mana)
Vitality (Effect: Increase maximum health)
Radiance (Effect: Increases summoner damage)
See the ingame UI for perks and their descriptions!

Improve the UI to fit more into Terraria's theme. (Currently it's just a placeholder)
Something to make this mod balanced (Open to suggestions)
